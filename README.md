Terminal based Tetris-like game with fully randomly generated blocks, developed with minimal external library usage. Unfortunately it only looks as intended in the VSC code terminal and it wouldnt surprise if it only looks so good on me, there are big differneces between different terminals and there is nothing I can do about it. Making the movement fun to move, eg. handling button press and realease for movement very difficult without adding additional libs so I skipped as I gre tired of the project. For the same reason I left some weird visual bugs that dont impact gameplay. It is buggy but I got it working and honestly, it is playable. Made just for fun.

Running:
go run main.go

thats it  

Controls: 
d - place block
c - swap block
space - rotate
